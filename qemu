QEMU Emulator installation
1.create a folder "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu"
2. download qemu-w64-setup-20211215.exe from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/2021/qemu-w64-setup-20211215.exe into "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu"
3. right click on "qemu-w64-setup-20211215.exe" and "Run as Administrator"
4. install QEMU. It will be installed at C:\Program Files\qemu
5 Add "C:\Program Files\qemu" to Windows Environment variable "Path"


5. download qemu-arm-img.zip from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C12uSIH37IZQgV9X0am8pBpwsP1laumL/view\6.
6. unzip (extract) qemu-arm-img.zip into "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu"
7. double-click on start.bat (windows batch file) in "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu\qemu-arm-img\Windows Scripts

8. Wait until you see "debian-aarch64 login:"

9. double-click on connect.bat (windows batch file) in "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu\qemu-arm-img\Windows Scripts
10. Enter password as root (now you are Linux. You can check Linux commands (ls, ls -ltr, ls -la, pwd, cd)

First Assembler program:
hello.s

1. create a folder by name "workdir" under "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu\qemu\qemu-arm-img\workdir"
2. copy hello-world.s to "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu\qemu\qemu-arm-img\workdir"
3. double-click on start.bat (windows batch file) in "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu\qemu-arm-img\Windows Scripts
4. Enter password as root
5. All files under "Computer Organization\Programming Assignment 0\qemu\qemu\qemu-arm-img\workdir" is now transferred to Linux under directory "wokdir"

6. Go to the Linux window (step 10)
7. cd workdir
8. ls -ltr hello-world.s

9. compile hello-world.s
gcc -o <program name> <filename>.s -g”

-o <program name>” determines the name of the resulting executable
“<filename>.s” specifies which ARM source file to attempt to assemble
“-g” links the program for debugging

gcc -o hello-world hello-world.s -g

10. ls -ltr *hello-world". You will find hello-world executable file
11. run hello-world
./hello-world

12. Enter poweroff
